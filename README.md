Hi there, I'm a MERN Dev, UI/UX Designer, and Blockchain Enthusiast! 🚀🎨

👨‍💻 Coding by day, curating art galleries in my mind by night. While I love building responsive websites and decentralized apps, my true passion lies in the Renaissance era and the smell of old novels. Yes, I dream in JavaScript and wake up thinking about Michelangelo!

📚 When I'm not debugging code, you might find me lost in the labyrinth of historical fiction or debating the finer points of Baroque art over Coffee. I believe every code should run as smoothly as a well-crafted novel and every user interface should be as intuitive as flipping through your favorite history book.

🎨 As a blockchain developer, I'm on a quest to combine the art of code with the history of tomorrow. Join me on this journey as we rediscover the past and code the future!

🤓 Fun fact: I might love coding, but if I could time travel, I'd be in a dusty library somewhere making friends with ancient philosophers or painting in Leonardo's workshop.

🔗 Let's connect and create something timeless!
